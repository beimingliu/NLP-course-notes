Project: _________________________

You'll be scored on each of the 6 primary sections. With each primary section, there are 4 levels that correspond roughly to C, B, A, and A+ work. 

1. Picked a novel, interesting problem at the appropriate challenge level
    
    1. Used a dataset from class. (C level work)
    2. Answered an obvious question. (B level work)
    3. Picked a common dataset. Combine existing questions in unique ways. (A level work)
    4. Analyzed a challenging dataset. Proposed original and meaningful questions. (A+ level work)

2. Preprocess data

    1. Data not ready for later analysis.
    2. Structured data 100% correctly. Handled missing values.
    3. Explored different methods.
    4. Benchmarked different methods. Handled especially tricky issues.

3. Summarized data

    1. No visualizations. No discussion of distributions. Calculated few statistics. 
    2. Inadequate visualizations. Fit inappropriate distributions. Inadequate descriptive statistics.
    3. Visualized enough to understand data. Fit the most appropriate distributions. Explored enough to understand data.
    4. Created novel visualizations. Compared multiple distributions. Fit distributions from outside of class. Found insights in data.

4. Fit models

    1. No model fitting.
    2. Attempted basic modeling. Incorrect application. Misinterpreted results.
    3. Correctly fit a single model. Correctly interpreted model results. Summarized model meaning.
    4. Compared multiple models. Fit models outside of class materials. Detailed numerical and visual analysis of models.

5. Delivery

    1. GitHub is unintelligible. Code is incomplete. 
    2. GitHub is confusing. Code does not work. Code is hard to read. No README. Commit messages are not helpful.
    3. GitHub repo is understandable. Code works. Code is readable. GitHub repo is understandable. Engaging narrative with insights and lessons.
    4. Live website / demo. Code is professional level (e.g., comments, docstrings, tests, and [pep8](http://pep8.org/) style) 

6. X factor

    1. Routine project
    2. Repeated analysis from class
    3. Showed creativity
    4. Ground-breaking
